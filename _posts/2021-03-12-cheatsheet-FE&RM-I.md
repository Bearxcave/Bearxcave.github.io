### Introduction to No-arbitrage

Consider the following contract

* Pay price *p* at time *t*=0
* Receive $c_k$ at time *t*=*k*, *k*=1, $\cdots$, *T*

The no-arbitrage condition bounds the price *p* for this contract:

* Weak No-Arbitrage: $c_k \geq 0$ for all $k \geq 1 \Rightarrow p \geq 0$
* Strong No-Arbitrage: $c_k \geq 0$ for all $k \geq 1$ and $c_l>0$ for some $l \Rightarrow p \geq 0$
